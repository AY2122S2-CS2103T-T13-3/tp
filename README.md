[comment]: <> (* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering &#40;SE&#41; students**.<br>)

[comment]: <> (  Example usages:)

[comment]: <> (  * as a starting point of a course project &#40;as opposed to writing everything from scratch&#41;)

[comment]: <> (  * as a case study)

[comment]: <> (* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application &#40;called _AddressBook_&#41; used for managing contact details.)

[comment]: <> (  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** &#40;around 6 KLoC&#41; than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.)

[comment]: <> (  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.)

[comment]: <> (* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` &#40;`AB3` for short&#41; because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects &#40;`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...&#41;.)
